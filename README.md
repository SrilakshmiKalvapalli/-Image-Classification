# -Image-Classification
• Developed & trained a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras on CIFAR-10, achieving 70%+ accuracy by
 processing 50,000 training and 10,000 test images with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers.
 • Optimized performance using the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss, enhancing
 feature extraction and monitoring training via validation accuracy & loss curves
